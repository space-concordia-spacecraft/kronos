/******************************************************************************
 * This project provides two demo applications.  A simple blinky style project,
 * and a more comprehensive test and demo application.  The
 * mainCREATE_SIMPLE_BLINKY_DEMO_ONLY setting (defined in this file) is used to
 * select between the two.  The simply blinky demo is implemented and described
 * in main_blinky.c.  The more comprehensive test and demo application is
 * implemented and described in main_full.c.
 *
 * This file implements the code that is not demo specific, including the
 * hardware setup and standard FreeRTOS hook functions.
 *
 * ENSURE TO READ THE DOCUMENTATION PAGE FOR THIS PORT AND DEMO APPLICATION ON
 * THE http://www.FreeRTOS.org WEB SITE FOR FULL INFORMATION ON USING THIS DEMO
 * APPLICATION, AND ITS ASSOCIATE FreeRTOS ARCHITECTURE PORT!
 *
 *
 * NOTE 1:
 *
 * This project has only been tested in the QEMU emulation of the HiFive board
 * from SiFive.
 *
 * NOTE - Requires QEMU 1908xx or higher.  Start QEMU using the following command
 * line:
 *
 * [your_path_1]\qemu-system-riscv32 -kernel [your_path_2]\FreeRTOS\Demo\RISC-V-Qemu-sifive_e-FreedomStudio\Debug\RTOSDemo.elf -S -s -machine sifive_e
 *
 * Where [your_path_1] must be replaced with the correct path to your QEMU
 * installation and the elf file generated by this project respectively.
 *
 *
 * NOTE 2:
 *
 * Start GDB using the following command line (this can be entered in the
 * Eclipse Debug Launch Configuration dialogue):
 *
 * riscv64-unknown-elf-gdb.exe -iex "set mem inaccessible-by-default off" -iex "set arch riscv:rv32" -iex "set riscv use_compressed_breakpoint off"
 *
 *
 * Note 3:
 *
 * Status information is sent to the QEMU serial console.
